I wanted to create a composition of mirrors on a wall in my room.

The room being the attic, the wall is triangular, and I didn't
know how to lay out the mirrors in a way that would fit them nicely
in the space.

So I wrote this clumsy program that allowed me to drag and drop
shapes on the screen, then used a projector to see the shape,
correctly scaled to the size of the mirrors, to the wall.

In this way I could arrange the mirror shapes, directly on the
wall, just with a mouse.

I then marked the shapes on the wall with a pencil, turned off
the projector, and glued the mirrors in position.
